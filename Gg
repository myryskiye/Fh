Europe Exchange Dex - Updated Functionality

1. High-Risk Token Exchange:
   - The platform allows users to exchange cryptocurrencies or tokens of the highest risk, including potential scam tokens.
   - Users can sell tokens received from unknown sources, even if these tokens are not accepted by other exchanges.
   - The implementation ensures that all tokens, regardless of their perceived legitimacy, can be traded.
   - This functionality eliminates the risk of financial loss for users caused by the inability to sell certain tokens.

2. Independence from Other Platforms:
   - The exchange does not consider or rely on opinions from other platforms about token legitimacy or risks.
   - Every token with tradeable value is treated equally, ensuring a user-friendly and inclusive environment.

3. Implementation Notes:
   - Custom smart contract logic enables the seamless exchange of any token type.
   - Security measures are in place to protect users from malicious contracts, while still allowing free trading.
